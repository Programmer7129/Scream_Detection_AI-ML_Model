## Introduction
The Scream Detection AI/ML Model is an innovative system developed to enhance the safety and security of our college community. The project aims to detect distress calls and screams in real-time, enabling immediate response and providing assistance to individuals in danger. This repository contains the source code and documentation related to the development and evaluation of the AI/ML model.

## Features
- Accurate detection of distress calls and screams
- Real-time response system
- Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for classification
- Support vector machines (SVM) for additional confirmation
- Visualizations for performance analysis
- Easy integration with specified locations in the community
